My own project in which I implemented a simple console application that works with MySQL via JDBC.
With this work I want to show my basic knowledge of working with MySQL and JDBC.

First you have to run the MySQL script NotesJDBCCreationScript.sql.
It crteates correct database on your local MySQL server.
You should enter your database settings (username and password) at the beginning of the application code in the marked place.

The project is launched directly from Intellij IDEA.
